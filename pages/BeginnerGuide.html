		<h1>Beginner Guide</h1>
		<p><b>Fighting games can be very intimidating for newcomers to the genre so here is a guide for people who are interested but are maybe overwhelmed by all the terminology and things that everyone keeps using.</p>
		<p>You can keep coming back to this as needed whenever there is something that is confusing. Additional links to other helpful resources will be provided at the bottom of the page so please take your time and have a look around and we hope you enjoy your journey down the fighting game path!</b></p>

		<h2>Mentality</h2>
		<p>One of the most important but also most overlooked aspects of any competitive game is the mental aspect involved. When you jump into a new game you're going to want to win, that goes without saying, but winning in fighting games can be very hard so its important to think about the conditions you need to win and which playstyle suits you the best. Think of fighting games as a sport that you will progressively get better at as you get more experience. Every top athlete started off with a ball and a general idea of "I need to get this to go there". Using soccer/football as an example, when you're starting out you will probably just try to get the ball from your opponent and run to the other side before your opponent can catch you. </p>

<h2>What To Play</h2>
<p>There are a lot of fighting games on the market and they're pretty expensive to get into if you're not sure if you'll even enjoy them so finding the one that better suits what you enjoy will be key to helping you not only have fun but also get better. The good thing is no matter which game you play, the core fundamentals will stick with you so once you break through the initial barrier, it will be easy to jump right into any fighting game that catches your eye and be able to pick up and play. There are a few subgenres of fighting games that help distinguish between the unique mechanics involved that some may prefer over others. These subgenres include:
<ul><b>2D</b>
    <li>Street Fighter 6</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>3D</b>
    <li>Tekken 6</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Platform</b>
    <li>Super Smash Bros Ultimate</li>
    <li>Brawlhalla</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Tag Team</b>
    <li>2XKO</li>
    <li>Dragon Ball FighterZ</li>
    <li>Marvel vs Capcom</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Arena</b>
    <li>Dragon Ball Sparking Zero</li>
    <li>Naruto Ultimate Ninja Storm Connections</li>
</ul>
<ul><b>Anime</b>
    <li>Guilty Gear Xrd Rev 2</li>
    <li>Guilty Gear Strive</li>
    <li>Melty Blood</li>
    <li>Dragon Ball FighterZ</li>
</ul>


<h2> Who To Play </h2>
<p>There are different major archetypes that fit different characters which can help you figure out which playstyle you prefer. If you end up enjoying a major archetype of character over others, then finding a main in other games will be a lot easier.</p>
		<ul>Rushdown</ul>
                      <li>Aggressive. Skip neutral and try to stay in opponents face and keep them on the defensive.</li>
                <ul>Zoner</ul>
                      <li>Long-range pokes. Keep enemy from getting in. Usually weak at close-range so game plan is to poke at a distance and keep opponent as far away as possible.</li>
                <ul>Shoto</ul>
                      <li>The "fundamentals" character, usually with a well-rounded kit that allows for a more 
                <ul>Grappler</ul>
                <ul>Puppet</ul>
                <ul>Stance</ul>
<p>These are not set in stone and the playstyle can be different within the major archetypes but this provides a general understanding of the archetypes. Some of the sub-archetypes that can fit into each of these styles are:</p>
                <ul>Mix-up</ul>
